      # Defaults to BACKUP. If all your nodes are configured to start as BACKUP,

      # Defaults to 100. This is the standard keepalived default. You can run all
      # your nodes with 100, and the one with the highest real IP will win. Or, to
      # create a preferred master, just launch that one container with a higher
      # value.

      # this to a specific interface name like eth0.
