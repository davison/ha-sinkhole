# ha-sinkhole Deployment Manifest
#
# PURPOSE:
# This file defines mutually compatible, versioned sets of ha-sinkhole components
# for specific deployment channels (e.g., stable, edge).
#
# RATIONALE:
# - It solves the **"mutable tag problem"** by explicitly mapping channels to
#   immutable semantic versions (e.g., 1.2.3), eliminating the container
#   runtime's tendency to use old cached images tagged 'stable' or 'latest'.
# - It replaces repository-wide **Git tags** which fail to support the
#   independent versioning necessary for mono-repo component updates (e.g.,
#   promoting a fix for component A without promoting a feature for component B).
#
# PUBLICATION:
# This file is published as an immutable artifact (not committed directly to
# the main branch) via the CI/CD pipeline, bypassing protected branch restrictions.

stable:
  # Component versions guaranteed to work together after integration testing.
